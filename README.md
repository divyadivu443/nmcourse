## Interactive form validation

### ðŸ“– Description/Aim

The Interactive Form Validation project is designed to enhance the user experience while filling out online forms by providing real-time feedback and validation. The system ensures that all the input fields are correctly filled before submission, thereby minimising user errors and improving data accuracy.
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic and responsive forms that validate user inputs such as email addresses, passwords, phone numbers, and other required fields. As the user types, the form instantly checks the input values and displays interactive error messages or success indicators without the need to refresh or submit the page.
